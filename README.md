#shortly-express

Simple web application to shorten url links. Simple express server authentication middleware
and bcrypt to hash passwords.

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
Hack Reactor's curriculum. This project was worked on with a pair; it's 
representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled, but not of my solo work.
